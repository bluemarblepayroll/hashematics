  # A Visitor is a Record found in the context of a Group.  When traversing the object
  # graph (group tree), it will provide these Visitor objects instead of Record objects
  # that allows you to view the Record in the context of the graph, while a Record is more of just
  # the raw payload provided by the initial flat data set.
